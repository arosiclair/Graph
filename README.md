Graph
=====

A very basic graph implementatio using ArrayLists and references between Vertex objects. Created for my PathX Mini-Game project.

Purpose
======
This Graph data structure was created to add path finding functionality to my PathX Mini-Game. The implementation is very 
simple and path finding is done using Dijkstra's algorithm. Overall, operations for this Graph are probably fairly slow, but fast enough for my Mini-Game's purposes. The Edge class was not used either for my Mini-Game and is left as-is for now.
